# Social Media Data Analysis

This repository contains my implementation of the Social Media Data Analysis task provided by Intern2Grow as part of their Data Analyst Virtual Internship Program.

## Task Overview

As part of the internship, I was required to analyze a dataset of social media posts and answer a set of questions using my data analysis skills. Below are the details of the task.

### Task 2: Social Media Data Analysis

You were given a dataset containing information about a fictional company's social media posts over the course of a year. The dataset is in the file `social_media_data.csv` and includes the following columns:

- **date**: The date of the post (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
- **platform**: The social media platform where the post was made.
- **post_type**: The type of the post (e.g., video, image, text).
- **likes**: The number of likes the post received.
- **shares**: The number of shares the post received.
- **comments**: The number of comments on the post.
- **views**: The number of views the post received.

### Questions to Answer

For this analysis, I addressed the following questions:

1. What was the total number of likes, shares, comments, and views (for videos) over the year?
2. Which platform had the highest engagement? (Engagement = likes + shares + comments)
3. What was the average number of likes, shares, comments, and views per post on each platform?
4. What was the total number of each type of post (video, image, text) on each platform?
5. Which type of post had the highest average engagement?
6. What was the total engagement in each quarter of the year?

### Implementation

- The analysis was performed using a Jupyter Notebook, which is included in this repository as `socialMedia.ipynb`.
- The final report summarizing the analysis and findings is provided in the `report_social_media.pdf` file.

### Submission Instructions

This repository serves as the submission for the task. It includes the dataset, analysis code, and the final report.

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this task, and I look forward to further feedback!
